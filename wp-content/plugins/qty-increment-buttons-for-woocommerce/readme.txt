== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Will this plugin work correctly on my website? =

Qty Increment Buttons for WooCommerce is designed to work on any WooCommerce-based website. It's tested for compatibility with version 3.0 (previously 2.6) and newer. Assumed to work since 2.3 in which quantity buttons were removed from WooCommerce core.

= How to make the buttons display on the Home page?

The buttons will display properly on a regular Home page that is also a WooCommerce shop or category page if the corresponding Archives display option in plugin settings is enabled. For a custom home page (or any other custom page), enabling the plugin to work on all pages in settings should do the trick. However, depending on how much it differs from regular WooCommerce page, the functionality and visuals can be negatively affected.

= My buttons are poorly aligned. How can I fix it? =

While very flexible in theme support, this plugin can't handle all custom layouts. The biggest offenders are themes using !important in their CSS rules that affect the quantity input field and the buttons. It can be solved by using the same selector with different rules in child theme's style.css or extra CSS if the theme allows it. Feel free to report CSS-related problems on the support forum.

= Will this plugin affect my page speed? =

Very little, it's a small plugin that executes only on product, cart, checkout, shop and category pages, unless an option to load the plugin on all pages is checked. CSS in the head is minified.

== Changelog ==

= 2.7.5 =
* Hotfixed an issue from 2.7.4 release that caused quantity buttons used by some themes to be visible and appear next to the plugin buttons.

= 2.7.4 =
* Added "buttons_added" class to div.quantity in quantity-input.php template. This will stop some themes from adding their own buttons.
* Updated the quantity-input.php template to be compatible with the one currently used by WooCommerce (version 4.0.0). The input fields will now receive "placeholder" attribute.
* Fixed a bug that happened while the quantity field was empty and a quantity button used. Now the "change" event triggers correctly and also Storefront's mobile bottom menu doesn't disappear.
* CSS - hide theme's default "-" and "+" buttons with a non-standard class if they have an <a> tag.
* CSS - fixed Add to cart button's formatting for related products. Now it's vertically aligned with the quantity buttons and its button text is vertically centered.
* CSS - fixed Add to cart button's vertical alignment on archive pages if it uses a top margin.
* CSS - fixed a rare case where unmerged buttons would not be perfectly vertically aligned with the input field.

= 2.7.3 =
* Hotfixed PHP 7.4 notice from a 2.7.2 release.

= 2.7.2 =
* Shop & category pages will no longer show quantity buttons for bundle products.
* Quantity will now be rounded to 2 decimal places for proper handling of fractional quantity plugins. It doesn't change how the plugin works for integer values.
* Avada theme - theme's increment buttons are now removed through deregister script.
* Astra theme - theme's increment buttons are now removed through filter.
* Astra theme - quantity increment buttons on archive pages will now use theme's custom hook for correct positioning.
* CSS - spin buttons that still showed within the quantity input field in Chrome for some websites will now properly disappear. Part of the fix is that quantity field backgrounds are set to 'none' by default.
* CSS - home page will be treated as a shop page in terms of applied CSS if the plugin is set to show the buttons on the shop page. It fixes a problem with Add to cart button not aligned properly on a home page.
* CSS - increased specificity to more reliably hide "-" and "+" buttons appearing by default in some themes. There can still be functional or visual issues that require properly removing such buttons by one of the following ways: theme settings, PHP filter, dequeuing a script.
* CSS - Add to cart button's text will now be centered in case your theme had a different idea about its positioning.
* Removed Spanish translation files from plugin core due to this translation no longer being maintained. All translations are now here, maintaned by contributors: https://translate.wordpress.org/projects/wp-plugins/qty-increment-buttons-for-woocommerce/
